# Fork of "Coder"
## This is the original stuff

## A simple way to make web stuff on Raspberry Pi

Coder is a free piece of software that turns a Raspberry Pi into a super simple platform that educators and parents can use to teach the basics of building for the web. New coders can craft small projects in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, right from the web browser.

## This is my thing
        
I forked this because I figured it would be good for building on for something else, maybe to add on, you never really know. :smirk:

### What I want to do

1. Add server-side code bits
2. Make it able to support multiple coder devices on a network
3. I had something, but I forgot. Will put that here
